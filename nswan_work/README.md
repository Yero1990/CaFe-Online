# Study Plan for Noah Swan
## Description
This github repository is intended to be used for and by the graduate student (Noah Swan) to save the work (relevant computer codes / notes) on this project (CaFe). The main part of the study plan will consist of giving an introduction to: <br>
	
1. general (e,e'p) simulations using the (e,e'p) simulation package, `SIMC`, used in Jefferson Lab Hall A and C.  <br>
	
2. actual data replay using the Hall C `hallc_replay` repository <br>

As a by-product of this study plan, Noah will also be familiarized with github used to organize and stored relevant codes/scripts in future work. Noah will also be familiarized with LaTeX when writing a paper in the final report of this plan.

**Specific Software Requirements** <br>
To successfully carry out this research project, the students are required to have installed the following: <br>

* GitHub (which is a web-based version-control and collaboratio platform for software developers)
	* `deut_simc` repository used for carrying out simulations
	* `hallc_replay` repository used to do data replay
* Python programming language (preferably recent version, e.g., Python 3.8.4)
* LaTeX (which is a document preparation system to facilitate the writing of research and scientific papers) 
* ROOT CERN (object oriented programming designed for physics data analysis <br>

NOTE: C++ should already be part of the system.

## Overview of Tasks/Meetings and Timeline
Noah will be assigned several tasks on a weekly basis to be completed by the end of each week, and we'll meet at the start of the following week to discuss the progress made and new tasks to be completed. The entire study plan will last 8 weeks (can be flexible, depending on difficulty of tasks), after which Noah will have the necessary tools to be able to carry out and analyze the upcoming CaFe experiment in Hall C (June 8-15, 2022) <br>

By the end of the program, Noah will provide **a 2-4 page report on what has been learned.** It is also encouraged to present a  10-20 informal talk on the topics learned during the study plan. This will help solidify what has been learned. <br>

> **We will meet on Mondays (flexible time) to discuss new tasks to be done during the week and Fridays (flexible time) to discuss work that has been done during that week.**

**In-Person Meeting Information:** <br>
Meeting Days:  Monday, Friday <br>
Meeting Time: flexible (8 am - 6 pm) <br>
