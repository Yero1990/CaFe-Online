Nov 24 Meeting on Hall C Software

1.  HCANA updates during PION LT (i.e., THcCoinTime.cxx, etc. on changing pTRIG4 to pTRIG3)
    We have made pTRIG4 to pTRIG3 changes in HCANA version of pion LT, but this has not
    been pushed to the official version. Is HCANA Pion LT a separate branch from the official
    HCANA? If that is the case, then a pull request can be made after making additional changes
    such as backward compatibility, in case someone updates HCANA locally, and wants to replay
    runs previous to the PION-LT 2021 run period.

    * Stephen will look into this and determine what changes have been made to hcana, and what
      updates need to be made before pushing changes to official HCANA

2)  How do you actually automatically update the excel sheet with the runs ?
    (maybe I have to look at the code you have to understand it, pleas send link)
    I wanted to have a similar setup for Hall C CaFe experiment upcoming ~ June 2022

    === Useful links to use as guide of how to setup filling excel sheet with run information ===

    https://github.com/JeffersonLab/UTIL_PION/blob/online_pionlt/scripts/runlist/fill_runList.sh

    https://github.com/JeffersonLab/UTIL_PION/blob/online_pionlt/scripts/runlist/kinfile.py

    https://github.com/JeffersonLab/UTIL_PION/blob/online_pionlt/scripts/runlist/reportfile.py


      
3.  How does the 50k replay actually find the latest ROOTfile? (I have to look at the code as well)
    See 50k replay script on cdaq online

   *How to check check latest run:
lastRun=$( \
     ls raw/shms_all_*.dat raw/../raw.copiedtotape/shms_all_*.dat cache/shms_all_*.dat -R 2>/dev/null | perl -ne 'if(/0*(\d+)/) {print "$1\n"}' | sort -n | tail -1 \
 )


4.  Im also currently working on trying to write a code (based on the source code that produces
    an updating histogram for online beam charge monitoring as well as rates, etc.)  I think
    it would be very useful for Hall C to also have this sort of monitoring, as it simplifies
    getting a general status of how the experiment is progressing.
